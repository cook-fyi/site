		<h1>Cook family website</h1>
		<p>This domain is being used to provide email addresses and subdomains to individuals who have the last name "Cook"</p>
		<p>If you also have the last name Cook, and would like to utilise a sub-domain of this (for example if your name is Mark, and live in the UK, you might want hello@uk.mark.cook.fyi), send me a message on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/fabiancook">https://twitter.com/fabiancook</a> or <a href="#contact">fill out the form below<a/></p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			I can't guarentee the sub-domain you want will be available, and there are other "Cook" domains available if yours isn't.<br/>
			I also may not be able to get back to contacting you very fast, but I will try!
		</p>
		<form id="contact" name="contact" data-netlify="true">
			<p>
		    	<label>Your Name: <input type="text" name="name" /></label>   
		  	</p>
			<p>
		    	<label>Your Region: <input type="text" name="region" /></label>   
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
		    	<label>Your Email: <input type="email" name="email" /></label>
		 	</p>
		  	<p>
		    	<label>Preferred domain: <input type="email" name="domain" /></label>
		 	</p>
		 	<p>
		    	<label>Any notes: <textarea name="notes"></textarea></label>
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
		    	<button type="submit">Request / Send</button>
		  	</p>
		</form>

			Who knows if this is a good idea, but I think it would be cool to have a domain for our family name!
